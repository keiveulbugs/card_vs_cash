# Digital Payment Methods

### Digital payments are considered any type of payment that happens electronically through digital channels and without the use of physical cash. 

### What are the main types of digital payments?

## Electronic bank transfers
Digital bank transfers are one of the most established forms of digital payments and are widely used in Germany, especially for invoices, rent, and larger transactions.
•	Standard transfers (SEPA Credit Transfer): Allow money to be transferred between bank accounts within the SEPA zone, usually within one business day.
•	Real-time transfers (SEPA Instant Credit Transfer): Enable near-instant payments, with funds credited to the recipient’s account within seconds.
•	Telegraphic transfers (TT / SWIFT transfers): Used mainly for international and high-value transactions that require speed and security.
These methods are considered reliable and secure, but they are less practical for small, everyday retail payments.

## Credit and debit card payments
Credit and debit cards are among the most widely used digital payment methods worldwide and have overtaken cash in many contexts.
•	Debit cards: The payment amount is immediately deducted from the customer’s bank account.
•	Credit cards: The card provider advances the payment, and the customer repays it later, usually monthly.
Card payments are fast and convenient for customers, but for merchants they involve transaction fees and a delay before funds are credited to their bank account.

## Contactless card payments
Contactless payments work similarly to traditional card payments but rely on near-field communication (NFC) technology. Customers simply tap their card or device on a payment terminal.
This method is particularly convenient for in-store payments, although it usually comes with transaction limits and potential security risks if a card is lost or stolen.

## Mobile wallets and mobile payments
Mobile payments allow users to pay using smartphones, smartwatches, or other smart devices. Digital wallets such as Apple Pay or Samsung Wallet store virtual versions of credit or debit cards and use NFC or QR codes to complete transactions.
Mobile payments also enable quick peer-to-peer transfers and are increasingly accepted by online and physical retailers due to their convenience and speed.

## QR code payments
QR code payments allow customers to scan a merchant’s QR code using a banking or payment app, select a payment method, and confirm the transaction digitally.
This method is fast, user-friendly, and does not require physical payment terminals, making it attractive for small businesses and temporary retail settings.

## Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) services
BNPL services enable customers to receive goods immediately while postponing payment or splitting it into instalments, often without interest for a limited period.
These services are especially popular in e-commerce, as they can increase purchasing power and conversion rates, although they may also encourage overspending.

## Peer-to-peer (P2P) payments
Peer-to-peer payments allow individuals to send money to each other digitally through apps linked to bank accounts or cards.
Although primarily used for private transactions, some P2P services are increasingly accepted by small businesses and online merchants.

## Cryptocurrencies
Cryptocurrencies are decentralised digital currencies based on blockchain technology, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. They are not issued by central banks and operate through distributed networks.
In Germany, cryptocurrencies are still mainly used for investment purposes, but some online platforms and selected businesses accept them as a payment method. Their adoption remains limited due to volatility and regulatory uncertainty.
