## Misconception 1: “Cash is cheaper than digital payments” 
Reality: While merchants often perceive card payments as expensive due to visible transaction fees, cash is not cost-free. Cash handling involves hidden costs: time spent counting money, transporting cash to the bank, security risks, and manual bookkeeping.

When labour, security, and handling costs are included, cash transactions in Germany are in fact more resource-intensive than card payments. This means that although card fees are more visible, the total economic cost of cash is often higher.

Our Munich interviews confirm this perception gap: shop owners focus on card transaction fees but rarely account for the full operational costs of managing cash, exactly the gap our cost-comparison calculator addresses.

## Misconception 2: “Germany cannot support digital payments because infrastructure is lacking”
Reality: Germany already has widespread NFC card terminals, mobile wallets, and instant bank transfers. The technological infrastructure for digital payments is in place. The barrier is not technology, but merchant cost concerns and cultural payment habits.

## Misconception 3: “Customers are the drivers behind the persistent use of cash” 
Reality: Interviews in Munich show that younger customers increasingly prefer card and smartphone payments, while shops continue to impose minimum card thresholds mainly due to fee concerns, not because customers reject digital payments. The demand for digital options is growing, but supply remains constrained by merchant cost considerations.
