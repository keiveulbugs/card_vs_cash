## Cash remains dominant, but digital is growing

![](/images/Chapter2piechart.png)
Germany is one of the most technologically advanced economies in Europe, yet cash remains the most frequent used payment method in everyday life. 


According to the Deutsche Bundesbank Payment Behaviour Study (2023), cash accounted for 51% of all points-of-sale (POS) transactions in Germany in 2023, down from 74% in 2017, but still the single most used method for daily purchases. 

At the same time, digital payments are increasing steadily: 
-	Card payments grew 11% year-on-year in 2024, reaching around 13 billion transactions and accounting for 40% of all payments by non-banks. 
-	SEPA instant credit transfers increased 37% in one year, showing rapid growth of real-time digital payments. 
-	The number of ATLs is slowly declining, reflecting gradual reduced dependence on cash access.
