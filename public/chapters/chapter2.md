# Current State
## Cash remains dominant, but digital is growing

![](/images/Chapter2piechart.png)
Germany is one of the most technologically advanced economies in Europe, yet cash remains the most frequent used payment method in everyday life. 


According to the Deutsche Bundesbank Payment Behaviour Study (2023), cash accounted for 51% of all points-of-sale (POS) transactions in Germany in 2023, down from 74% in 2017, but still the single most used method for daily purchases. 

At the same time, digital payments are increasing steadily: 
-	Card payments grew 11% year-on-year in 2024, reaching around 13 billion transactions and accounting for 40% of all payments by non-banks. 
-	SEPA instant credit transfers increased 37% in one year, showing rapid growth of real-time digital payments. 
-	The number of ATLs is slowly declining, reflecting gradual reduced dependence on cash access.

# Why is Cash still so popular?

: Research and interview conducted in Munich show that the persistence of cash is driven by a mix of cultural, economic, and practical factors. 

Cultural and historical trust in cash 
-	Cash is perceived as fast, reliable, and privacy-preserving. 
-	Historical experiences with inflation and surveillance has shaped strong preferences for financial anonymity. 
-	Privacy concerns make many consumers hesitant about data sharing in digital payments. 

Economic reasons for merchants 
-	Small businesses face transaction fees for card payments that cut into thin margins. 
-	Most interviewed shops accept card payments only above a minimum amount to avoid high per-transaction costs. 
-	Several shops reported that card fees average around €0.20 per transaction, which is costly for small-value items. 
-	Many merchants stated that cash is simpler to manage and avoids administrative overhead. 
-	Note: further on this website, you can observe that these costs are overstated, and that cash is actually more expensive to use. 

Operational convenience 
-	Cash is immediate, does not require terminals, and avoids technical failures. 
-	In crowded cafés or markets, card terminals are seen as slowing down service, however this can be challenged by saying that cash is time consuming as well (counting, etc.).

These trade-offs explain why many German shops adopt hybrid solutions (accepting both cash and card), but imposing minimum card amounts. 

Title: What doe Munich shop owners say? 
Our interviews with 11 local businesses revealed: 
-	Most shops accept cash and card, but only above a minimum purchase threshold. 
-	Transaction fees are the main barrier to wider card acceptance.
-	Many customers simply buy extra items to reach the card minimum.
-	Some shops have removed limits, responding to younger customers’ preferences for card payments. 

Overall, merchants describe the current system as “working fine”, reducing urgency to change.
