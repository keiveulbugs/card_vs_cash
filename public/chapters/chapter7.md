# Who are we?
Hi, we are Alessia, Héloïse, Job, Maria and Elise. We are students on the Politics and Technology Master’s Programme at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). This website was created as part of a university project, supervised by Dr. Laura Mahrenbach, which looked at how technological solutions could be leveraged to tackle development challenges in Germany.

While shopping and eating out in Munich, we have experienced the often inconvenient and complicated ways of paying due to the limited digital payment options available. As our group consists mainly of international students from Spain, Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium, we have noticed the significant differences in cash usage across European countries. 

We hope this page has provided you with useful insights into the unique German context, helping both shop owners and consumers to make better payment decisions. 

If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact us via email: SmartPayTUMStartUp@gmail.com
